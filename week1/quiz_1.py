# Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers at most equal to some value
# input by the user, and of length also input by the user, and outputs a list
# consisting of the longest streak of consecutive occurrences of the same value in L,
# possibly looping around (as if the list was a ring). In the case multiple value
# have the longest streak of consecutive occurrences in L, then the smallest value is chosen.
